Purpose:
The original goal was to find targets from a autonmous drone in AUVSI SUAS 2018. Targets consisted of
cardboard cutouts of different colors and shapes, and would be contained in pictures taken any where 
from ~150ft to 400ft in the air. Most targets were assumed to be on grass and tarmac backgrounds.

I have since transfered from my original school to University At Buffalo after being accepted into their Computer Science program.
